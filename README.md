# telegram-analysis

 My goal for this project was to analyze interpersonal relatiоnships through Telegram private dialogs downloaded beforehad. More specifically, 
I selected top-10 people by the total number of messages since they are supposed to be the closest to me. So, the vast majority of questions is focused on
 different aspects of those personal dialogs and in set to bring some clarity on how those dialogs differ.
  For the sake of anonimity (and because I usually save people in contacts with weird names), the names of top-10 people were replaced with programming languages. 

Throughout this analysis I've answered 26 questions, results to almost all of which are displayed through charts and diagrams.

You can look through my work either by downloading the .ipynb file and opening it through Jupyter notebook or by viewing it directly from this repo on GitHub.
