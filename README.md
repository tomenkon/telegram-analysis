# telegram analysis

This is a university project which goal is to analyze telegram messaging data using jupyter notebook.

If you wish to do a similar project, instructions on how to download you telegram data are here [https://github.com/SanGreel/telegram-data-collection]  and here [https://github.com/SanGreel/telegram-dialogs-analysis-v2].
After following them you should have all the data downloaded on your local machine, but keep in mind that I'll take quite a long time.

If you wish to reuse my analysis for yourself, then assuming you've already downloaded the data, clone this repo and move the 'data' folder to the project folder. 
Or you could also changed the specified paths in .epynb file to match the location of the data on your computer. 

My goal for this project was to analyze interpersonal relatiоnships through Telegram private dialogs downloaded beforehad. More specifically, 
I selected top-10 people by the total number of messages since they are supposed to be the closest to me. So, the vast majority of questions is focused on
 different aspects of those personal dialogs and in set to bring some clarity on how those dialogs differ.
For the sake of anonimity (and because I usually save people in contacts list with weird names), the names of top-10 people were replaced with programming languages. 
(But if you reuse this project then your contact names will be as you saved them, because renaming I did manually in the csv file)
